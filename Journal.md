Q1. What skills have you developed so far?

I belive im developing my computational thinking, for loops, and also how to working on the terminal. 
but back to coding, im a bit afraid that it is taking a long time for me to get the consepts and the new ideas.

Q2. What have worked for you in the classroom for Computer Science ?

i think practicing codes in the class helped me, so i can ask my classmates or Dr.Ruben
also the warm up activites are helpful.

Q3. What are some things/activities strategies that you would change in the Computer Science ?

when coding, get more time to understand the consepts and the straucture of the codes
